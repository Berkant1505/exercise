**1. What is Python?**
 
**Answer:** *Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.*

<br>

**2. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?**

**Answer:** *PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python Community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing in the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.l*

<br>

**3. Is indentation required in python?**

**Answer:** *Indentation is necessary for Python. It specifies a block of code. All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is specified within an indented block. It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily, it will not execute accurately and will throw errors as well.*

<br>

**4. What is an Interpreted language?**
 
**Answer:** *An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.*

<br>

**5. What are the primary components of a computer system?**

**Answer:** *The primary components of most computer systems are the central processing unit, the memory and the input and output devices. The CPU is typically an arithmetic logic unit, control unit or both. The memory of a computer system refers to both the primary and secondary memory.*
